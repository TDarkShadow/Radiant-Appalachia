Special Thanks to "ThaMan" for the textures, I did what I could to make them 2k without losing quality. I welcome them to include this pack in their own Nexus mod page, as well.

How to install:

Place "WaterSD.ba2" in your Fallout76 Data folder.

Open "Fallout76.ini" located in the "Documents\My Games\Fallout76\...". This is where the config files are stored.

Look for the line under [Archive] that starts with "sResourceArchive2List" and copy the entire line.

If it doesn't exist already, create a "Fallout76Custom.ini" in the same folder, and paste the copied line into it.

Next, append (add) whichever .ba2 archives you're wanting to load after the last entry in the line.

For example: as of The Pitt update, the line should look like this in your Fallout76Custom.ini , though it may vary depending on what other .ba2 archives you'd like to load along with it.


[Archive]
sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - StaticMeshes.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateVoices.ba2, WaterSD.ba2


If the developers add new entries / archives to the sResourceArchive2List, repeat the process mentioned above and include any newly added entries in the line into Fallout76Custom.ini .
