nexusDescription="[b][What does this mod do?][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Replaces the water textures to be somewhat more visually appealing than vanilla. Using ThaMan's textures as a starting point, it maintains quality while cutting down on VRAM usage and also making sure the textures tile seamlessly.\n<br />\n<br />It's been a long time since ThaMan's released his \"Enhanced Water\" mod, and while they mentioned planning a 2k texture version, it never really materialized on their page, as far as I know.\n<br />\n<br />This mod aims to change that somewhat, though I welcome ThaMan to make use of the textures / archive included with this cosmetic mod for themselves.\n<br />\n<br />You can find the original mod package [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/563]here[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[b][How to install?][/b]\n<br />\n<br />See the included ReadMe for a quick walkthrough of how to load additional .ba2 archives, including this mod's archive.\n<br />\n<br />[b][Is it safe? / Is it allowed?]\n<br />\n<br />[/b]It's a simple cosmetic texture replacer for water, and only includes textures. Thus far I've found it pretty safe to use.\n<br />\n<br />As for if it's \"allowed\", you're probably asking the wrong person and/or are in the wrong place to be asking. :P\n<br />\n<br />[b][Conclusion][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Thank you for viewing, hopefully this is useful for those interested! Enjoy!"
