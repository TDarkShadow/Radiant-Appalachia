nexusDescription="[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32]Better Inventory[/url] hasn't been updated in over a year now, some things have changed in the game and the last version 1.5.5 is no longer compatible with Fallout 76. The design of Better Inventory was quite well done, the underlying code still works but the integration between the mod an the pipboy interface broke when Bethesda added the extra info to the itemcard for weapons an armor a couple patches ago. The autopatcher for better inventory could be modified to work with the latest game version, but is not a one-click solution. This is my attempt at making a.... 3 click solution autopatcher that *should* continue working in the future. Due to the permission restrictions on the better inventory you will need to download the last version of betterinventory and copy it to the unzipped BetterAutopatch folder. You will also need to supply the latest interface file from fallout76 every time fallout76 updates (located at &lt;Fallout76 Install Folder&gt;&#92;Data&#92;SeventySix - Interface.ba2)"
