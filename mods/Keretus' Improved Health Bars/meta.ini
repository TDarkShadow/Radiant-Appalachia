nexusDescription="original mod: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/368]Improved Health Bars[/url]\n<br />\n<br />I don't know where else will be a better place to upload Keretus' mod with fixes while letting him have the power to make decisions over its existence, so here it is on nexusmod.\n<br />\n<br />beth has added in segments for health bars. that's great but...the notification HUD still gets jammed from being overloaded with messages.\n<br />the fix has been built with what Keretus has begun, and so it shall continue to be credited to him.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]also added in this mod:\n<br />potentially fixed notifications getting jammed at any time for anything. treasure maps, nuke code reset etc.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]I don't have a ghoul character to make good on the glow. will update accordingly when I do[/size]"
