nexusDescription="[b]NEW:[/b] Brazillian Portuguese translation [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/1330?tab=files]avaliable here[/url] by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/users/2084138]gbrloffspring[/url], or found in the optional downloads!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=4]Description:[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Tired of Fallout 76 treating you like you're still in school? Sick of annoying and esoteric quizzes?\n<br />Well so was I, and so luckily for you: \"there's a mod for that\"!\n<br />\n<br />This mod marks the beginning of each correct answer with an (X). No more blind guessing required!\n<br />\n<br />--------\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][u]Quizzes Included:[/u][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]- Firebreather's Exam\n<br />- Enclave Questionnaire [b][1][/b]\n<br />- Hornwright Executive Exam\n<br />- Pioneer Scout Quizzes[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][1][/b] [i]This quiz uses a point-based system, so instead of (X) it instead uses (+1), (+2), etc.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />-------------------------------\n<br />[b][size=4][u]Installation:[/u][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Download the SST dictionary version. You will need to manually merge the changes this mod makes with whatever other mods you have that are editing the same STRING files. To do this, you will need [b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134]xTranslator[/url][/b].\n<br />\n<br />If you do not know how to do this, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/users/1177217]amadcow4u2[/url] made an excellent tutorial on how to merge SST dictionaries with existing mods. Download [b]Plan Naming and Workshop Placeables Fixes - Compatability Edition[/b] version from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/193?tab=description]here[/url], and look at the included readme files. The process it goes over is exactly the same way to install this mod.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />-------------------------------\n<br />[b][size=4][u]QA:[/u][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q:[/b] B-but quizzes are how we learn! How dare you!\n<br />[b]A:[/b] I love learning as much as (well, way more than) the next guy, but I don't need this stuff in my action RPG games, thanks.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q:[/b] You're contributing to the stupidity of humanity, you know!\n<br />[b]A:[/b] I very much doubt that anyone who doesn't want to learn here is going to get anything out of these quizzes anyways.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q:[/b] Isn't this cheating?\n<br />[b]A:[/b] It sure is! Though it's certainly not the kind of cheating that affects other people in any way.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q:[/b] Can you add X quiz?\n<br />[b]A:[/b] If I forgot about one or (god forbid) Bethesda adds more, let me know and I'll include em!\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q:[/b] Do you have a full list of the answers in a text document?\n<br />[b]A:[/b] I don't, but someone else made one. You can find it [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QE7jKymF-dURn38lNfLnHMkOGYRa1Pi5HWkfD2RQaPs/htmlview?sle=true#gid=0]here[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q:[/b] This only works for English. Do I have your permission to translate it?\n<br />[b]A:[/b] Absolutely! You have my full support to translate this mod into whatever language you'd like! When you're finished, I can either host it as an optional file with the main mod here, or you can upload it as a separate mod.\n<br />\n<br />-------------------------------\n<br />[size=4][u]Changelog:[/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />v1.2:\n<br />- Updated prepackaged BSA for Fallout76 v1.2.0.15 (EDIT: Can't do precompiled anymore)\n<br />\n<br />v1.1:\n<br />- Updated prepackaged BSA for Fallout76 v1.1.5.4 (EDIT: Can't do precompiled anymore)\n<br />\n<br />v1.0:\n<br />- Initial Release.\n<br />[/spoiler]"
