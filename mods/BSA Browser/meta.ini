It was originally only for .BSA files hence the name BSA Browser. However it's been updated it to support .BA2 files as well.\n<br />\n<br />BSA Browser is open source and available from GitHub: [url=https://github.com/AlexxEG/BSA_Browser]BSA_Browser[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[heading][color=#93c47d][size=5]Features[/size][/color][/heading]\n<br />[list][*][size=2]Browse and extract file(s) from BSA and BA2 files[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Sort by folder, file name, file size, or extension. Ascending or descending[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Search for files, with optional Regex support[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Drag &amp; drop file extraction[/size]\n<br />[/list][list][*][size=2]Browse multiple archives simultaneously[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Recent files list[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Quick export (See Tools -&gt; Options menu)[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=4][url=https://github.com/AlexxEG/BSA_Browser#credits]Credits[/url] on GitHub[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[heading][color=#93c47d][size=5]Install &amp; Uninstall[/size][/color][/heading]\n<br />Use the provided installer or portable version, which you just extract &amp; run.\n<br />\n<br />[heading][color=#93c47d][size=5]Version History[/size][/color][/heading]\n<br />[size=4]1.17.0[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Added right click menu options to remove all loaded or unloaded archives\n<br />[*] Added support for B5G6R5_UNORM textures\n<br />[*] BSA Browser will now attempt to translate hashes in Morrowind.bsa archives without name table (e.g. Xbox)\n<br />[*] CLI: Added --exclude option, same as -f option but opposite\n<br />[*] CLI: Multiple filters can now be defined and mixed (simple, exclude, regex).
