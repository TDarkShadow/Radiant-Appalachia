nexusDescription="The IconSortingTags mod by mcguffin is indispensable for me. Since there haven’t been any updates since 2023, I took the initiative to add the missing icons and fix as many bugs as I could (e.g. Legendary mods with \"L\" at the end). This is just an update to the header rules file of mcguffin's IconSortingTags mod. Installation instructions can be found on his linked mod page.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Added Tags for[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Meta-Items (Plasma Rifle &amp; Gatling)\n<br />[*]Apparel-Items\n<br />[*]Plan Source\n<br />[*]Injected/Hacked Plans and Apparel\n<br />[*]Non Player Tradable Plans\n<br />[/list][/list]\n<br />The icon/tag assignments follow the same scheme as the Tagged Rare Plans and Apparel mod. I didn’t include the separate plan-rating icons, because IconSortingTags already provides its own blueprint ratings (0 to 3 stars). I have also adjusted the blueprint-star assignments. \n<br />\n<br />Blueprint stars are determined by drop chances, availability (e.g., seasonal events), player popularity (e.g., new or buff-camp items), and a bit of my own assessment. Corrections may still be needed. \n<br />\n<br />Icons for 2- to 3-star mod effects have been restored. 4-star mod effects are reused icons from armor and weapon effects (1-3 Stars). They may be improved if other icons are known that fit better. \n<br />\n<br />Tested only with the German version of Fallout 76 under the FULL_ALL_Default (EN, DE, ES, ESMX, FR, IT, PL, PTBR, RU) and with new added FULL_ALL_GERFIX (same as Default + German fixes) load order.\n<br />\n<br />Huge thanks to mcguffin for the brilliant IconSortingTags mod ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/146]https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/146[/url]) and to datablitz7 for the Tagged Rare Plans and Apparel mod ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/1409]https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/1409[/url])."
